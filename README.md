Agreement takes contracts defined by the suppliers, and entered into the system by admins and makes 
them available to members so that they can agree to them.

Members choose and agree to contracts for specific locations, sending the agreement to suppliers for approval.

Suppliers approve or deny the agreement for the locations.

Admins publish the agreements on behalf of the suppliers, causing them to appear in the member library.
